Blank Tape was a podcast co-created by Kurt Crenwelge and Anson Jablinski. The show ran from June 2018 to January 2020 and consists of fifty audio episodes, including a dozen or so bonus content tracks. We've since shut down the [Fireside](https://fireside.fm) hosting for the show, but all the content is archived here:
