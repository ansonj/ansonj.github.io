## [GitHub: `ansonj`](https://github.com/ansonj)

My most recent and frequently-updated projects are [on GitHub](https://github.com/ansonj).

## [Blank Tape]({% link projects/blanktape.md %})

**2018-2020**. Blank Tape was a podcast that I co-hosted with my friend Kurt. The original website and hosting for the show are shut down, but we've [archived the episodes and metadata here]({% link projects/blanktape.md %}).

## [Brickspace]({% link projects/brickspace.md %})

**2014**. Brickspace was an iPad app that I built during a summer research internship at the [University of Houston](https://uh.edu). The app is no longer in the App Store, but the [code is on GitHub](http://github.com/ansonj/Brickspace). I've also written [a summary of the project]({% link projects/brickspace.md %}) and [a deep dive on how it works](http://ansonj.org/blog/2014/10/2/brickspace-and-the-structure-sensor).
